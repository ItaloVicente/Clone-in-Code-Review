## Repository Structure

The workflow is divided into distinct phases across two repositories:

1. **Phase 1** is executed in the [`CROP Update`](https://github.com/your-org/CROP-Update) repository.  
   This phase focuses on extracting code reviews and revisions from the original dataset.

2. **Phases 2, 3, and 4** are carried out in this repository: [`Clone Analysis`](https://github.com/your-org/Clone-Analysis).  
   These phases cover clone extraction, treatment, manual validation, and lifecycle analysis.

Each repository contains its own `README.md` with more detailed explanations of the respective phases and usage instructions.
The `git_repos` repository can only be shared at a later stage to ensure anonymity.
