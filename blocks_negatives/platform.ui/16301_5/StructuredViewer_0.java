	 * element map is updated according to the value of <code>fullMap</code>.
	 * If <code>fullMap</code> is <code>true</code> then the current mapping
	 * from element to widgets is removed and the new mapping is added. If
	 * full map is <code>false</code> then only the new map gets installed.
	 * Installing only the new map is necessary in cases where only the order of
	 * elements changes but not the set of elements.
