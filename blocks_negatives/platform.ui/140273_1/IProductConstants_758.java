    /**
     * An image to be used as the window icon for this product (16x16).
     * Products designed to run "headless" typically would not have such an image.
     * <p>
     * The value is either a fully qualified valid URL or a path relative
     * to the product's defining bundle.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the <code>WINDOW_IMAGES</code> property is given, then it supercedes
     * this one.
     * </p>
     * @deprecated use WINDOW_IMAGES instead (see recommendations there)
