 * <li> The dialog store is read the first time <code>getDialogSettings</code>
 *      is called.</li>
 * <li> The dialog store allows the plug-in to "record" important choices made
 *      by the user in a wizard or dialog, so that the next time the
 *      wizard/dialog is used the widgets can be defaulted to better values. A
 *      wizard could also use it to record the last 5 values a user entered into
 *      an editable combo - to show "recent values". </li>
 * <li> The dialog store is found in the file whose name is given by the
 *      constant <code>FN_DIALOG_STORE</code>. A dialog store file is first
 *      looked for in the plug-in's read/write state area; if not found there,
 *      the plug-in's install directory is checked.
 *      This allows a plug-in to ship with a read-only copy of a dialog store
 *      file containing initial values for certain settings.</li>
 * <li> Plug-in code can call <code>saveDialogSettings</code> to cause settings to
 *      be saved in the plug-in's read/write state area. A plug-in may opt to do
 *      this each time a wizard or dialog is closed to ensure the latest
 *      information is always safe on disk. </li>
 * <li> Dialog settings are also saved automatically on plug-in shutdown.</li>
