 * This interface should be implemented by selection listeners
 * that want to be notified when the selection becomes <code>null</code>.
 * It has no methods. It simply indicates the desire to receive
 * <code>null</code> selection events through the existing
 * <code>selectionChanged</code> method. Either the part or the
 * selection may be <code>null</code>.
