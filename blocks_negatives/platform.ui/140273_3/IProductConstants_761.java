     * An image which can be shown in an "about" dialog for this
     * product. Products designed to run "headless" typically would not
     * have such an image.
     * <p>
     * The value is either a fully qualified valid URL or a path relative
     * to the product's defining bundle.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A full-sized product image (no larger than 500x330 pixels) is
     * shown without the "aboutText" blurb.  A half-sized product image
     * (no larger than 250x330 pixels) is shown with the "aboutText"
     * blurb beside it.
