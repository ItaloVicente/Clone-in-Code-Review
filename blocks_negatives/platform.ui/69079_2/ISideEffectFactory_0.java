	 * Runs the given supplier until it returns a non-null result. The first
	 * time it returns a non-null result, that result will be passed to the
	 * consumer and the ISideEffect will dispose itself. As long as the supplier
	 * returns null, any tracked getters it invokes will be monitored for
	 * changes. If they change, the supplier will be run again at some point in
	 * the future.
	 * <p>
	 * The resulting ISideEffect will be dirty and resumed, so the first
	 * invocation of the supplier will be asynchronous. If the caller needs it
	 * to be invoked synchronously, they can call
	 * {@link ISideEffect#runIfDirty()}
	 * <p>
	 * Unlike {@link #create(Supplier, Consumer)}, the consumer does not need to
	 * be idempotent.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is used for gathering asynchronous data before opening an
	 * editor, saving to disk, opening a dialog box, or doing some other
	 * operation which should only be performed once.
	 * <p>
	 * Consider the following example, which displays the content of a text file
	 * in a message box without doing any file I/O on the UI thread.
	 * <p>
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * IObservableValue&lt;String&gt; loadFileAsString(String filename) {
	 * }
	 *
	 * void showFileContents(Shell parentShell, String filename) {
	 *   IObservableValue&lt;String&gt; webPageContent = loadFileAsString(filename);
	 *   ISideEffect.runOnce(webPageContent::getValue, (content) -&gt; {
	 *   	MessageDialog.openInformation(parentShell, "Your file contains", content);
	 *   })
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @param supplier
	 *            supplier which returns null if the side-effect should continue
	 *            to wait or returns a non-null value to be passed to the
	 *            consumer if it is time to invoke the consumer
	 * @param consumer
	 *            a (possibly non-idempotent) consumer which will receive the
	 *            first non-null result returned by the supplier.
	 * @return a side-effect which can be used to control this operation. If it
	 *         is disposed before the consumer is invoked, the consumer will
	 *         never be invoked. It will not invoke the supplier if it is
	 *         paused.
