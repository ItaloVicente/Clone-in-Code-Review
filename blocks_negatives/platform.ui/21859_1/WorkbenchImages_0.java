 * This class provides convenience access to many of the resources required
 * by the workbench. The class stores some images as descriptors, and
 * some are stored as real Images in the registry.  This is a pure
 * speed-space tradeoff.  The trick for users of this class is that
 * images obtained from the registry (using getImage()), don't require
 * disposal since they are shared, while images obtained using
 * getImageDescriptor() will require disposal.  Consult the declareImages
 * method to see if a given image is declared as a registry image or
 * just as a descriptor.  If you change an image from being stored
 * as a descriptor to a registry image, or vice-versa, make sure to
 * check all users of the image to ensure they are calling
 * the correct getImage... method and handling disposal correctly.
