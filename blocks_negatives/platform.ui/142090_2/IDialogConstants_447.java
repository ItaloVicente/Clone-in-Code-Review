    /**
     * The label for hide details buttons.
     * Using this static label string provides optimum performance by looking
     * up the label only once when JFace is initialized.  However, clients that
     * wish to support multiple locales in one system should instead use the pattern
     * <code>JFaceResources.getString(IDialogLabelKeys.HIDE_DETAILS_LABEL_KEY)</code>
     * so that a locale other than the default may be consulted.
