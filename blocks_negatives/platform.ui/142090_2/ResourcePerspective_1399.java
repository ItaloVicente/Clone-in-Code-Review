    /**
     * Defines the initial layout for a perspective.
     *
     * Implementors of this method may add additional views to a
     * perspective.  The perspective already contains an editor folder
     * with <code>ID = ILayoutFactory.ID_EDITORS</code>.  Add additional views
     * to the perspective in reference to the editor folder.
     *
     * This method is only called when a new perspective is created.  If
     * an old perspective is restored from a persistence file then
     * this method is not called.
     *
     * @param layout the factory used to add views to the perspective
