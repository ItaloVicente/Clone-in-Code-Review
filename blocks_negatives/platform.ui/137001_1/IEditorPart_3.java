 * An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is
 * typically used to edit or browse a document or input object. The input
 * is identified using an <code>IEditorInput</code>.  Modifications made
 * in an editor part follow an open-save-close lifecycle model (in contrast
 * to a view part, where modifications are saved to the workbench
 * immediately).
