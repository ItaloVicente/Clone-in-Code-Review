	 * @param numberFormat
	 * @param toType
	 * @param min
	 *            minimum possible value for the type, can be <code>null</code>
	 *            as BigInteger doesn't have bounds
	 * @param max
	 *            maximum possible value for the type, can be <code>null</code>
	 *            as BigInteger doesn't have bounds
	 * @param boxedType
	 *            a convenience that allows for the checking against one type
	 *            rather than boxed and unboxed types
