	 * If this page already has an editor open that matches the given input
	 * and/or editor id (as specified by the matchFlags argument), that editor
	 * is brought to the front; otherwise, a new editor is opened. Two editor
	 * inputs are considered the same if they equal. See
	 * <code>Object.equals(Object)<code>
	 * and <code>IEditorInput</code>. If <code>activate == true</code> the editor
	 * will be activated.
