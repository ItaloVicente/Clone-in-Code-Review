	 * Normally one should use <code>openError</code> to create and open one
	 * of these. This constructor is useful only if the error object being
	 * displayed contains child items <it>and </it> you need to specify a mask
	 * which will be used to filter the displaying of these children. The error
	 * dialog will only be displayed if there is at least one child status
	 * matching the mask.
