	 * The <code>Dialog</code> implementation of this framework method creates
	 * a standard push button, registers for selection events including button
	 * presses and registers default buttons with its shell. The button id is
	 * stored as the buttons client data. Note that the parent's layout is
	 * assumed to be a GridLayout and the number of columns in this layout is
	 * incremented. Subclasses may override.
