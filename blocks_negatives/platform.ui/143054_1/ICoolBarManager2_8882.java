    /**
     * Synchronizes the visual order of the cool items in the control with this
     * manager's internal data structures. This method should be called before
     * requesting the order of the contribution items to ensure that the order
     * is accurate.
     * <p>
     * Note that <code>update()</code> and <code>refresh()</code> are
     * converses: <code>update()</code> changes the visual order to match the
     * internal structures, and <code>refresh</code> changes the internal
     * structures to match the visual order.
     * </p>
