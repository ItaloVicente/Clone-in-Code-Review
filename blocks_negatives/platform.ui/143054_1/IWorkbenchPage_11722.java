	 * The visible views and their layout within the page also change. If a view
	 * is specified in the new perspective which is not visible in the old one a
	 * new instance of the view will be created. If an old view is not specified
	 * in the new perspective it will be hidden. This view may reappear if the
	 * user selects it from the View menu or if they switch to a perspective
	 * (which may be the old one) where the view is visible.
