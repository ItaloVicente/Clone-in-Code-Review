	 * A named preference indicating where the fast view bar should be docked in
	 * a fresh workspace. This preference is meaningless after a workspace has
	 * been setup, since the fast view bar state is then persisted in the
	 * workbench. This preference is intended for applications that want the
	 * initial docking location to be somewhere specific. The default value
	 * (when this preference is not set) is the bottom.
