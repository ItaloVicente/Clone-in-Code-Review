    /**
     * Preference name constant for linking editor switching to navigator selection.
     *
     * [Issue: We're cheating here, by referencing a preference which is actually defined
     * on the Workbench's preference page.  The Navigator should eventually have its own
     * preference page with this preference on it, instead of on the Workbench's.
     * The value must be the same as IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants.LINK_NAVIGATOR_TO_EDITOR.]
