 * The Eclipse platform provides an extension point (<code>"org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport"</code>)
 * for plugging in a help system UI. The help system UI is an optional
 * component; applications may provide a UI for presenting help to the user by
 * implementing a subclass and including the name of their class in the
 * <code>&lt;config&gt;</code> element in an extension to the
 * <code>"org.eclipse.ui.helpSupport"</code> extension point.
