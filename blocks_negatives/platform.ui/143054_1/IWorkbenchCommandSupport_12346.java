	 * Adds a collection of handler submissions for consideration by the
	 * workbench. The submission indicates to the workbench a set of conditions
	 * under which the handler should become active. The workbench, however,
	 * ultimately decides which handler becomes active (in the event of
	 * conflicts or changes in state). This could cause the handlers for one or
	 * more commands to change.
