	 * Creates a workbench preference dialog to a particular preference page.
	 * Show the other pages as filtered results using whatever filtering
	 * criteria the search uses. It is the responsibility of the caller to then
	 * call <code>open()</code>. The call to <code>open()</code> will not return
	 * until the dialog closes, so this is the last chance to manipulate the
	 * dialog.
