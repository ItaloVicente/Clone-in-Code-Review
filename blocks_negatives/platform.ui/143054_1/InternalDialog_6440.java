	 * Show the details portion of the dialog if it is not already visible.
	 * This method will only work when it is invoked after the control of
	 * the dialog has been set. In other words, after the
	 * <code>createContents</code> method has been invoked and has returned
	 * the control for the content area of the dialog. Invoking the method
	 * before the content area has been set or after the dialog has been
	 * disposed will have no effect.
