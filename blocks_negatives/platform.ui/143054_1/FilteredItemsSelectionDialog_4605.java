	 * @param item
	 *            an object from the content provider. Subclasses should pay
	 *            attention to the passed argument. They should either only pass
	 *            objects of a known type (one used in content provider) or make
	 *            sure that passed parameter is the expected one (by type
	 *            checking like <code>instanceof</code> inside the method).
