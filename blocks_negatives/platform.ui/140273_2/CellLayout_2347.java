 * <p>The various subclasses of <code>IColumnInfo</code>
 * can be used to create columns with fixed width, columns whose width is computed
 * from child controls, or width that grows in proportion to the size of other
 * columns. Layouts can be given a default <code>IColumnInfo</code> that will
 * be used to set the size of any column whose properties have not been explicitly
 * set. This is useful for creating layouts where most or all columns have the
 * same properties. Similarly, the subclasses of <code>IRowInfo</code> can be used to
 * control the height of individual rows.</p>
