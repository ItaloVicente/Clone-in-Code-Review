     * Retrieves the image descriptor for specified image from the workbench's
     * image registry. Unlike <code>Image</code>s, image descriptors themselves do
     * not need to be disposed.
     *
     * @param symbolicName the symbolic name of the image; there are constants
     * declared in this interface for build-in images that come with the workbench
     * @return the image descriptor, or <code>null</code> if not found
