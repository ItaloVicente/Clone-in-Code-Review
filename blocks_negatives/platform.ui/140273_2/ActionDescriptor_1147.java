 * When 'action' tag is found in the registry, an object of this
 * class is created. It creates the appropriate action object
 * and captures information that is later used to add this action
 * object into menu/tool bar. This class is reused for
 * global (workbench) menu/tool bar, popup menu actions,
 * as well as view's pulldown and local tool bar.
