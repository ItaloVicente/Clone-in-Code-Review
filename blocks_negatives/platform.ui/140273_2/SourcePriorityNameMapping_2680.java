	 * @param sourceName
	 *            The name of the variable as it would appear in an XML
	 *            expression; must not be <code>null</code>.
	 * @param sourcePriority
	 *            The priority of the source with respect to other sources. A
	 *            higher value means that expressions including this priority
	 *            will win ties more often. It is recommended that this value is
	 *            simply a single bit shifted to a particular place.
