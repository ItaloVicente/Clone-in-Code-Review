     * The foreground color to be used when reporting progress at startup.  
     * Products designed to run "headless" typically would not define this
     * property.
     * <p>
     * The value is a six-digit hexadecimal number. The first two digits
     * specify the red component of the color, the next two digits the
     * green component, and the last two digits the blue component.
     * </p>
