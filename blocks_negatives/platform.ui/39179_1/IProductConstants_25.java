    /**
     * The rectangle relative to the splash image's top left corner where
     * the progress bar for reporting progress at startup should be shown.  
     * Products designed to run "headless" typically would not define this
     * property.
     * <p>
     * The value is a comma-separated list of four integer values, specifying
     * x, y, width, and height of the rectangle in pixel coordinates.
     * </p>
