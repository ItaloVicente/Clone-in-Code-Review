     * Returns the marker being created or modified.
     * For a new marker, this returns <code>null</code> until
     * the dialog returns, but is non-null after.
     * <p>IMPORTANT:  Although this method is protected and the class is
     * internal, there are public subclasses that expose this method as API.
     * Changes in this implementation should be treated as API changes.
