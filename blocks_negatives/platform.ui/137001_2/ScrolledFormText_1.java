 * ScrolledFormText is a control that is capable of scrolling an instance of
 * the FormText class. It should be created in a parent that will allow it to
 * use all the available area (for example, a shell, a view or an editor). The
 * form text can be created by the class itself, or set from outside. In the
 * later case, the form text instance must be a direct child of the
 * ScrolledFormText instance.
