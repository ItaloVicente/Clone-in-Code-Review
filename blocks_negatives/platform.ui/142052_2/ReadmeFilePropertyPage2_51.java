 * This page demonstrates conditional property pages which look
 * different depending on the state of the element. In this example,
 * the arbitrary condition chosen is whether the Readme file is
 * greater than 256 bytes in length. If it is smaller than 256 bytes
 * in length, this will be a placeholder page containing
 * a simple message. If it is 256 bytes or larger, additional
 * information will be provided. This information is determined at
 * runtime.
