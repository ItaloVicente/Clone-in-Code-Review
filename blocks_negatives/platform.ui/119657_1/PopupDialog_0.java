	 *            A boolean indicating whether the bounds (size and location) of
	 *            the dialog should be persisted upon close of the dialog. The
	 *            bounds can only be persisted if the dialog settings for
	 *            persisting the bounds are also specified. If a menu action
	 *            will be provided that allows the user to control this feature,
	 *            then the last known value of the user's setting will be used
	 *            instead of this flag.
