 * Represents a Git repository. A repository holds all objects and refs used for
 * managing source code (could by any type of file, but source code is what
 * SCM's are typically used for).
 *
 * In Git terms all data is stored in GIT_DIR, typically a directory called
 * .git. A work tree is maintained unless the repository is a bare repository.
 * Typically the .git directory is located at the root of the work dir.
