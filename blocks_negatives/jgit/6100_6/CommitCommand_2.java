	 * @throws JGitInternalException
	 *             a low-level exception of JGit has occurred. The original
	 *             exception can be retrieved by calling
	 *             {@link Exception#getCause()}. Expect only
	 *             {@code IOException's} to be wrapped. Subclasses of
	 *             {@link IOException} (e.g. {@link UnmergedPathException}) are
	 *             typically not wrapped here but thrown as original exception
