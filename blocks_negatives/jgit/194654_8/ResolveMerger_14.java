	 *            Controls what to do in case a content-merge is done and a
	 *            conflict is detected. The default setting for this should be
	 *            <code>false</code>. In this case the working tree file is
	 *            filled with new content (containing conflict markers) and the
	 *            index is filled with multiple stages containing BASE, OURS and
	 *            THEIRS content. Having such non-0 stages is the sign to git
	 *            tools that there are still conflicts for that path.
	 *            <p>
	 *            If <code>true</code> is specified the behavior is different.
	 *            In case a conflict is detected the working tree file is again
	 *            filled with new content (containing conflict markers). But
	 *            also stage 0 of the index is filled with that content. No
	 *            other stages are filled. Means: there is no conflict on that
	 *            path but the new content (including conflict markers) is
	 *            stored as successful merge result. This is needed in the
	 *            context of {@link org.eclipse.jgit.merge.RecursiveMerger}
	 *            where when determining merge bases we don't want to deal with
	 *            content-merge conflicts.
