 * Unlike a List, the members of the sequence are not directly obtainable, but
 * element equality can be tested if two Sequences are the same implementation.
 * <p>
 * An implementation may chose to implement the equals semantic as necessary,
 * including fuzzy matching rules such as ignoring insignificant sub-elements,
 * e.g. ignoring whitespace differences in text.
