     *  - The provided cas doesn't match the one of the enclosing document: {@link CASMismatchException}
     *  - The enclosing document is not JSON: {@link DocumentNotJsonException}
     *  - The enclosing document does not exist: {@link DocumentDoesNotExistException}
     *  - The path doesn't exist entirely and <code>createParents</code> is set to false: {@link PathNotFoundException}.
     *  - The path contains a node that is used as a wrong type (eg. "some.sub" where "some" is actually an array): {@link PathMismatchException}
     *  - The path ends at an array index (eg. "some.array[1]"): {@link PathInvalidException}
     *  - The durability constraint could not be fulfilled because of a temporary or persistent problem: {@link DurabilityException}
     *
     * Other error conditions include document-level error conditions (similar to those of {@link #replace(Document)})
     * and generic sub-document-level error conditions (all of which extend {@link SubDocumentException},
     * like {@link PathTooDeepException}).
     *
     * Contrary to document-level {@link #upsert(Document)}, the document's CAS is actually taken into account if
     * provided in the fragment parameter, and the internal mutation will be rejected if the enclosing document was
     * externally modified.
     *
     * @param fragment a {@link DocumentFragment} pointing to the path to mutate and containing the new value to apply.
     * @param createParents true
     * @param persistTo the persistence constraint to watch (or NONE if not required).
     * @param replicateTo the replication constraint to watch (or NONE if not required).
     * @param <T> the type of the fragment value.
     * @return an {@link Observable} emitting the {@link DocumentFragment} corresponding to the mutated value, with
     * updated cas metadata.
