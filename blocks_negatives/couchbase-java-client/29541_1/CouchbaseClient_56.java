  /**
   * Poll and observe a key with the given CAS and persist settings.
   *
   * Based on the given persistence and replication settings, it observes the
   * key and raises an exception if a timeout has been reached. This method is
   * normally utilized through higher-level methods but can also be used
   * directly.
   *
   * If persist is null, it will default to PersistTo.ZERO and if replicate is
   * null, it will default to ReplicateTo.ZERO. This is the default behavior
   * and is the same as not observing at all.
   *
   * @param key the key to observe.
   * @param cas the CAS value for the key.
   * @param persist the persistence settings.
   * @param replicate the replication settings.
   * @param isDelete if the key is to be deleted.
